## Description

'0x00. AirBnB clone - The console' group project.

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

The first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone:
	- HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each tasks are linked and will help to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
